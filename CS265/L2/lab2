Q9
echo $? displays the exit status of the most recently called command.
Its 0 for the first grep call and 1 for the second call as grep returns an
exit status of 0 if true and 1 if false.
if grep encounters an error (such as file not found for the third call) it
returns 2. Hence, the echo $? returns 2 after the third call.
