the GameState class and Move class, and all the other functions which were
defined in Part 1 of the assignment.

2) hw.cpp: This is the main file that needs to be compiled. It conatains the
main funtion and the algorithms for BFS, DFS and iterative deepening, and
also the RandomWalk funtion.

3) hw1: this is the executable file generated on compiling hw.cpp

4) Makefile: this file compiles and generated the hw1 executable file.

5) README: this is the README.


Running the program:
1) Enter "make" in the command line to compile and generate the hw1
executable file.
2) execute hw1 by typing "./hw1" in the command line.

Compilation instructions for manual compilation:
    compile using "-std=c++11".
   example: g++ -std=c++11 hw.cpp -o hw1
