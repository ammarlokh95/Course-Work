Assignment 5

The program transforms the polygon by scaling/rotating/translating it. 

The function names should be self explanatory.

Function transformPolygon() uses the provided command line operator arguments to transform the polygon.
clipPolygon() takes four values which correspond to the world view bounds provided.

My clip function does not draw the line at x=min (0) and so my fill function gives a weird output. 
I've provided Make commands and an extra script (reuntests_nofill.sh) to display the output without by drawing the polygon lines instead

Compile:
	g++ STD=c++11 -o hw4 hw4.cpp

Run: 

	./hw5 -f [FILENAME] ... (other commands)


A make file is included with the following functions:
compile : compiles the program
run : runs the runtests.sh script
run_nofill : runts the runtests_nofill.sh script (same as runtests.sh but with an added command to switch from fill to draw)
all : compiles and runs both the runtests.sh and reuntests_nofill.sh test scripts.
clean : deletes all .xpm files in the current folder
