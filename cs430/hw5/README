Assignment 4
The program works using the scan filling algorithm to fill polygons.

The function names should be self explanatory.
two new functions are add: fillPolygon and switchFlag.
fillPolygon gills the most recently drawn polygon with black (represented by +) in the xpm file.
switchFlag is a helper function to switch the parity-bit.

All of the sample files working perfectly.

NOTE: the file hw4_9.ps was causing a lot of issues due to the sudden change of formatting, so I edited it to make it
compatible with my code, because I didn't have enough time and will to deal with it then.


Compile:
	
	g++ STD=c++11 -o hw4 hw4.cpp

Run: 
	
	./hw4 -f [FILENAME]


A make file is included with the following functions:
compile : compiles the program
run<n> : runs the program taking hw4_<n>.ps as command line argument (note: <n> should be replaced with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
all : compiles and runs the program once for all of the different test files.
